This is my personal website that sometimes has a resume posted.

## Installation

Feel free to clone the project.

```bash
npm install http-server
```

## Usage
Currently I'm just importing in the header file with stylesheets in the /assets folder.

```html
  <!-- CSS only -->
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-wEmeIV1mKuiNpC+IOBjI7aAzPcEZeedi5yW5f2yOq55WWLwNGmvvx4Um1vskeMj0" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/main.css">
  <!-- JavaScript Bundle with Popper -->
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-p34f1UUtsS3wqzfto5wAAmdvj+osOnFyQFpp4Ua3gs/ZVWx6oOypYoCJhGGScy+8" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```
Start the server outside the public folder.
```bash
http-server
```

## Contributing
I'm looking to take Javascript development more seriously this year and would like to make this a nice portfolio website with some projects. Any help or networking would be great. Don't hesitate to reach out.
